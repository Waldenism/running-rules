        <h4> 1. Enjoy Running </h4>
        <p>
          Running is not for everyone, figure out if you enjoy lacing up and running miles. This sport has a lot to offer and has about the widest accessibility of any. A 90's ad put it best "There are clubs you can't belong to, neighborhoods you can't live in, schools you can't get into, but the roads are always open." It is a sport you can keep progressing in and there are communities for it through the course of a life time. But life is very short and precious. Even with its access I cede running is not something everyone finds joy in. If you are not looking forward towards your run each day, either see if you can change something to make it fun, or reasses if running is for you. What ever brings you joy see if you can make your enjoyment contagious, poitivity breeds positivity.

        <h4> 2. 80% rule </h4>
        <p>
          At times refered to as the 'Pareto Principle' in business. The 80/20 relationship appears everywhere: 80% of the land is owned by 20% of the people, 80% of sales come from 20% of clients, 20% of the living room floor gets 80% of the wear, etc. How does this apply to running? Well in a sport that is so cumulative and it is so vital to stay healthy. 

          It might sound crazy, but do not exceed 80% of maximum effort in workouts. Reaching beyond that 80% the risk of injury spikes way up and the benefits are marginal. And say you do get through a workout where you gave it 95% by the time you get to the next workout or race you are not fully recovered and even with another 95% effort your body only gives you 60%, then you might be feeling down cause you had a bad one, so you go out and crush 95% the following, starting this yo-yo pattern. It is better to just put in a solid effort day in and day out. Take baby incremental steps and maintain your health. 80% workouts ensures you run best on race day, and avoid leaving your best at practice. This is the formula for success in the long term.

        <h4> 3. Little Things </h4>
        <p>
          I often hear people talk about doing the "little things" this can be turned around to your advantage. The "little things" come up in many domains, not just running, but in running these "little things" often include: streching, core, diet, planning ahead and having that chocolate milk and bananna ready after every run, recovery, sleep, and basically anything accessory to running. But in refering to them as "little" this belittles actions that are actually quite important. Slandering such activies makes it seem like you do not have to do them or they can be cut out. While all those "little things" may only provide marginal benefits on thier own, when taken in aggregate these "things" ammount to something quite large. So these "little things" should actually be thought of as the "BIG things" Do the 'big things' Do your core. Do your strides. Get to bed. The list goes on, get it all done, no shortcuts, no excuses.

        <h4> 4. Mind <-> Body </h4>
        <p>
          There is a connection between the body and mind. This connection is an important aspect for a runner. 

          This connection is a tool. 
          This tool is like a blade. 
          This tool can be trained, honed, sharpened and strengthened, with proper training and practice. 

          This tool can be leveraged to an advantage. Just like aerobic capacity this connection can keep getting stronger year after year. Listen to your body. The body is constantly sending you signals, some are subtle some are not. Listen for each heart stroke, try and feel your blood pump from within, feel each and every point through out your whole body. Listen for each breath, feel the rich air pour in providing fuel to convert to energy and the dispelling of poor air making way for more rich air. Listen for each step, the bounce of the ground is the whole body complex giving you what you expect? Are the balls of your feet catching you softly? Are your arches helping absorb shock? Are your calves giving your the power? Are your hips as mobile as they need to be? Is your core engauged? Is your arm carriage effcient? Is the interplay of the cardiovascualr and muscularskeltal systems operating at the threshold of oxygen consumtion, this is a signal you can learn to read. Be perceptive of your biology, of your physiology, of your anatomy. With your mind try to gain supreme control of the body, gain the ability to control actions at other times might be involuntary. Rule 4, listen to body with an attentive mind.

        <h4> 5. Choices </h4>
        <p>
          You, me, and everyone else are not the same people they were moments ago, and will not be the same people moments from now. We are all constantly in a process of transformation. Aging, growing, and repairing. It's by the choices we make that this constant transformation is a matter of progression or regression. It is the choices 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, year after year. Not just the choices one makes from 3-5pm August-October. Everyone works hard at practice its what you do while not at practice and not in season where the difference is made.

        <h4> 6. 20 minute </h4>
        <p>
          The 20 minute rule is to be applied on meet day. Following a good or bad performance, you as an athlete get roughly 20 minutes to feel some type of way, after that you have to put it behind you and look forward. If you won the day, you can bet those who didn't are already plotting how to knock you off. If you lost, getting upset or wollowing in defeat is only getting in the way of your progress; find the silver lining and move on. Outside of those 20 minutes, you have to be pretty emotionless, you can not get too up or down about anything, even keeled, working towards your improvement.

      <div class="entry7">
        <h4> 7. The worse the better </h4>
        <p>
          If something surrounding the conditions of a competition is less than ideal, it can be easy to start falling into negative thinking. "It is too muddy or windy to run fast" "I am cold and uncomfortable I can't run well" Luckily you are reading this rule and have the hack to beat this kind of thinking. Realize the conditions of the race are out of your control and will be exactly the same for everyone. If anything poor conditions are an advantage to those who know this secret because it will only get in thier competitiors heads and not thier own; hence the rule "the worse the better"

      <div class="entry8">
        <h4> 8. Expect low, aspire high </h4>
        <p>
          Expectations are a fickle thing, one must mind them carefully. The higher an expectation is set the higher the chance is of falling short of that expectation. Whereas setting low expectations means one can be constantly exceeding expectations. Careful though, exceeding a low expectation can also mean low achievement, so these low expectations must be coupled with high aspirations. If you aspire high and fall short you can still relish in smashing what you expected.

      <div class="entry9">
        <h4> 9. Believe </h4>
        <p>
          No matter what, you have to believe in what you are doing, believe in yourself, and believe in those around you. You can bet very few who have won a state title have gone in with thoughts "I have a bad coach", "I have bad training", "I have not prepared well" NO they are thinking thoughts like "I have the best coaches", "I have had the best training", "I've done everything to prepare" And not only are champions thinking thoughts like these on the line but in the many moments leading up to the performance. If you come to the line without having bought in or believeing you have already lost.

      <div class="entry10">
        <h4> 10. Save Your Best for Last </h4>
        <p>
          You can not go to the well every race. Definately get in there and compete hard in earlier races, but there has to be piece of you emotionally you have to save back for those 1 or 2 races a year where you really want to do your best. That final gear, that fit of rage, that big adreline incredible hulk jolt of fury, must be harnessed and savored for that big moment. Race instincts must be developed and that can not happen going through the motions.
